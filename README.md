# Plants-Bees-
The primary goal is to create areas teeming with native and non-native plants carefully selected to enhance the overall well-being of pollinator bees. By leveraging a combination of both plant types, we aim to provide a diverse and sustainable environment that fosters the health and prosperity of these vital pollinators. 🌼🐝

## 💪 Challenge
Provide your agency with a report that covers the following:
* A clean dataset. This means converting the columns to the correct data type, dealing with missing values ...
* Which plants are preferred by native vs non-native bee species? To determine which plants are preferred by native and non-native bees, use a machine learning algorithm by choice.
* A visualization of the distribution of bee and plant species across one of the samples.
* Select the top three plant species you would recommend to the agency to support native bees.
* A small conclusion with your recommendations.
