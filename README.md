# Plants-Bees-
The primary goal is to create areas teeming with native and non-native plants carefully selected to enhance the overall well-being of pollinator bees. By leveraging a combination of both plant types, we aim to provide a diverse and sustainable environment that fosters the health and prosperity of these vital pollinators. 🌼🐝
